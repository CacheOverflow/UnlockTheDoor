# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how UnlockTheDoor ("we," "our," or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile application for iOS and Apple Watch (the "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

UnlockTheDoor is an open-source application designed to provide convenient hotel room access through digital key functionality.

## Information We DO NOT Collect

We want to be clear: **UnlockTheDoor does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers because we don't have any servers.** 

We do not collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Analytics or usage statistics
- Crash reports
- Advertising identifiers
- Any form of tracking data

## Information Processed Locally

The app processes the following information exclusively on your device:

### Hotel Access Links
- **What**: SMS links provided by your hotel (format: `http://k3y.in/[code]`)
- **Purpose**: To authenticate and unlock your hotel room door
- **Storage**: Temporarily stored in device memory during your stay
- **Deletion**: Automatically cleared when the session expires or when you close the app

### Session Data
- **What**: Authentication tokens and session cookies from the hotel's system
- **Purpose**: To maintain your authenticated session with the hotel's door system
- **Storage**: Stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage
- **Deletion**: Automatically removed upon session expiration or app removal

### App Preferences
- **What**: Language preference, dark mode setting
- **Purpose**: To customize your app experience
- **Storage**: Stored in iOS UserDefaults on your device
- **Deletion**: Removed when you uninstall the app

## Third-Party Services

### Hotel Door Systems
When you use the app to unlock your door, the app communicates directly with your hotel's door management system (such as Pyn Guest). These communications:
- Use industry-standard HTTPS encryption
- Only transmit the authentication token provided by your hotel
- Are not monitored or logged by us
- Are subject to your hotel's privacy policy

**Important**: Your hotel's system may have its own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing your hotel's privacy policy for information about how they handle your data.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. The app only facilitates direct communication between your device and your hotel's door system.

## Data Security

We implement the following security measures:
- All communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Session data is stored in iOS's secure keychain
- No data is transmitted to third parties except your hotel's system
- The app includes no analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs

## Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not collect any information from any users, regardless of age.

## International Users

This app can be used internationally wherever compatible hotel systems are available. Since no data is collected or transmitted to us, there are no international data transfer concerns.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, correction) don't apply. However, you always have the right to:
- Delete the app from your device at any time
- Clear the app's local storage through iOS settings
- Refuse to provide hotel access links to the app

## Apple-Specific Disclosures

### iOS Permissions
The app may request the following permissions:
- **Paste from Clipboard**: To allow you to paste hotel access links
- **Internet Access**: To communicate with hotel door systems
- **Haptic Feedback** (Apple Watch): To provide tactile confirmation

### Apple Watch
The Apple Watch companion app operates under the same privacy principles:
- No data collection
- Local storage only
- Direct hotel system communication only

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Changes are effective immediately upon posting.

Since the app doesn't collect user information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We recommend checking this policy periodically if you have concerns.
